# Neural Style Transfer Implementation
Implementing 'A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style' paper in Tensorflow/Keras.   
I took on this project to help further my understanding of how neural networks work.

### Visualizations of images at different convolutional layers
In the paper, they visualize the outputs of the VGG19 model at different layers, so I do the same with my images:  

#### Style image:

> 'block1_conv1', 'block2_conv1', 'block3_conv1', 'block4_conv1', 'block5_conv1'
